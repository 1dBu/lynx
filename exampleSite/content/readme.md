## Installation

Lynx supports several installation methods - as a Hugo Module (easiest), a git submodule, or as a completely manual install.

Below is a quick start guide using Hugo modules.

### Quick start using Hugo

> **Note:** Ensure you have **Go** and **Hugo** installed, and that you have created a new Hugo project before proceeding.

1. From your project directory, initialise Hugo Modules:

   ```shell
   hugo mod init github.com/<username>/<repo-name>
   ```

2. Create `config/_default/module.toml` and add the following:

   ```toml
   [[imports]]
   path = "github.com/jpanther/lynx"
   ```

3. Start your server using `hugo server` and the theme will be downloaded automatically.

4. In the root folder of your website, replace the `config.toml` file that was generated by Hugo with the one from Lynx. You will find the theme config file in the Hugo cache directory, or [download a copy](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/jpanther/lynx/tree/stable/config.toml) from GitHub.

5. Follow the [configuration instructions](#configuration) below.

### Installing theme updates

As new releases are posted, you can update the theme using Hugo. Simply run `hugo mod get -u` from your project directory and the theme will automatically update to the latest release.

## Configuration

The main theme configuration is managed in the `config.toml` file. Most parameters are self explanatory and the default config contains some basic examples.

The author name and image are displayed at the top of the page. Both are optional and will default to the site title with no image when not provided.

Links can either be a simple string containing the URL for the link, or an object that defines the link parameters. Links are displayed in the order provided in the config file.

Acceptable link parameters are:

- `href` = the URL the link should point to
- `icon` = the name of the icon to use for this link (optional)
- `text` = the link text (optional)

```toml
[author]
links = {
   # Simple link
   { github = { href = "https://github.com/jpanther/lynx", text = "Visit my website" }}

   # Custom link
   { link = { href = "https://github.com/jpanther/lynx", text = "GitHub Project", icon = "github" }}
}
```

Additional page content can be provided by creating a Markdown file at `content/_index.md`. The contents of this file will be displayed between the title and links. Check out the exampleSite to see this in practice.

Basic content pages can also be created by placing Markdown files in the `content` directory. These can then be linked to using links in the config file or through the homepage content.
